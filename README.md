# HardCodedSecret
Description:
In this version, the application includes a hard-coded secret directly in the code. This demonstrates why storing sensitive data in plaintext is insecure — if someone gains access to the repository, they can see the credentials.

Explanation:
This method is insecure because secrets are directly visible in the source code. If the repository is public, anyone can view the secret.
